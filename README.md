# navier
Navier-Stokes solvers and CFD models written in C++ and modern Fortran. Ultimate goal is to have a fully-realized CFD software suite containing a library of finite-volume solvers and models, compiled in modern Fortran, wrapped in a C++ interface. GUI library provided by Qt, visualization and post-processing provided by VTK.
